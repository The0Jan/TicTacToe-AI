# TicTacToe-AI

Exercise done for course "Introduction to Artificial Inteligence".

## Exercise
Write a program/script that builds a game tree for a game of tic-tac-toe on a 3x3 board (rules: https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B3%C5%82ko_i_krzy%C5%BCyk), and then plays the game by itself. Implement three ways to run the game:

 - In a randomized fashion

 - Using exhaustive review

 - Using a minimax algorithm with a heuristic function of your choice and a different maximum number of forward moves analyzed

Compare the distributions of results for a large number of games of players a vs. b, a vs. c, and b vs. c. 
Analyze the execution times for each algorithm.
